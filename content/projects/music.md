Music has always been a passion of mine and I have found several different ways to explore that interest!
- <b>Nothing But Vocals - </b>
This is my all-male acapella team which competes across the country in the A3 competition circuit. Personally, I sing <b>bass</b>!
- <b>Dance - </b>
I have been dancing on several teams both competitively and passively since I was 4! I have travelled between countries exploring this interest of mine.
- <b>Instruments - </b>
Although I am originally a <b>drummer</b>, I also play the <b>guitar and beatbox</b>. I have used these skills in bands that I have created with my friends.
- <b>Beatboxing - </b>
Beatboxing is a true passion of mine and my favorite beatboxers are <b>Codfish, D-low, and Napom.</b>
