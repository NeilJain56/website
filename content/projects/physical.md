- <b>Gym - </b> Going to the gym is always nice and I attempt to go 4-6 times a week! I focus on weight lifting and honestly do not enjoy cardio. 
- <b>Chiropracting - </b> This is a real passion of mine, and I spend several hours learning about the science behind it. If I had infinite time, I definitely would get my license.
