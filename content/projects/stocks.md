Stock trading is a new passion of mine. Although there is a lot of speculation in the market currently due to COVID-19 I like to make my trading decisions based on <b>Fibonacci Retracement, RSI values, volume, Bollinger Bands and moving averages.</b> Although I do not day trade, I would like to use my computer science skills to build a trading bot eventually.
