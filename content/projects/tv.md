Television is part of everyones lives. My favorite shows include <b>Chuck, Psych, White Collar and The Office.</b> Some of my favorite movies are <b>The Avengers, The Maze Runner, and Home Alone!</b> I also spend a good portion of time on Youtube supporting creators. Besides the educational videos on youtube, I enjoy watching shows such as <b>America's Got Talent and the Voice</b> on Youtube. In fact a special talent of mine could be that given any youtube video from a show such as the voice, within a few second I will likely be able to tell the which video it is and likely recite it to an extent.
